Fully static content is in `root/`, and running

```
make
```

deploys them to `_site` which should be served at the root of this component.

Periodically generated content is generated by the daemon `update.py`. A template systemd.service file is attached. Generated content is placed in `data/` and should be served at `/data/` of this component. Note that

1. A `client_secrets.json` with read-only access to the channel's analytics data is required;
2. Run `./setup.sh` to authenticate interactively and configure permissions for the web server.
